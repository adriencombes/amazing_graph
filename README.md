## Troubleshoot :

Does this make me a hacker ?<br>
*Yes, totally. The matrix is yours now. Go get it. :3*

I had a repository named "dont_name_me_like_that" and your f\*\*\*ing script deleted it.<br>
*Dude, did you really name a repository "dont_name_me_like_that" ? Can't you listen to it ? :(*

I used to enjoy this git functionnality, and I think you kinda ruined it.<br>
*Shut up, nerd. You're just a dweeb. Get a life man, it's embarassing. Seriously do something, get laid I don't know.*

How long to boil eggs ?<br>
*Easy : Dippy 3min - Runny yolks 6min - Hard 9min. :)*

Your code is pretty shitty man. Very poor arguments use, and there's not even the complete alphabet.<br>
*Bro, you got consider this is mainly the work of a pretty high version of me. I mean, is it the only thing that tickles you here ?*

Hey kids ! Do you like violence ?<br>
*You're too late Marshall sorry. The real slim shady call was an hour ago.*

Don't you think you overload git's servers for dumb things ?<br>
*Probably. Sorry :/*

Was this dialog thing really wrote by two different persons ?<br>
*Depends if you hear two different voices in your head or only one. ^^*

How can I delete all this dots and come back to before ?<br>
*Just delete the repo "dont_name_me_like_that". It will make the associated commits disappear.*

Where can we insult you ?<br>
*The best way to reach me is through Paypal. Plus, you'll enter a lotery that gives you a chance to win a golden ticket. A very precious ticket that gives you the right to kiss my a\*\*. Anytime, anywere you want, but only once. Otherwise twitter.*

Do you prefer github or gitlab ?<br>
*Honestly ? Never made the difference. For me it's just the UI changing.*

How to defeat Malenia ?<br>
*Multiplayer. Frostbite and Hemorrhage. But mostly multiplayer.*

This script doesn't work.<br>
*Have you tried turning it off and on again?*
